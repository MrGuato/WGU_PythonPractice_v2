# Step 1: Read wall height, width, and cost of one paint can
wall_height = float(input())
wall_width = float(input())
paint_can_cost = float(input())

# Calculate wall area
wall_area = wall_height * wall_width

# Output wall area to one decimal place
print("Wall area: {:.1f} sq ft".format(wall_area))

# Step 2: Calculate amount of paint needed (in gallons)
paint_needed = wall_area / 350.0

# Output paint needed to three decimal places
print("Paint needed: {:.3f} gallons".format(paint_needed))

# Step 3: Calculate number of 1-gallon cans needed
cans_needed = math.ceil(paint_needed)

# Output cans needed
print("Cans needed: {} can(s)".format(cans_needed))

# Step 4: Calculate paint cost, sales tax, and total cost
paint_cost = cans_needed * paint_can_cost
sales_tax = 0.07 * paint_cost
total_cost = paint_cost + sales_tax

# Output paint cost, sales tax, and total cost with two decimal places
